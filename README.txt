Hello Everyone. 

I am a fledgling internaut. 

I have been interested in programming for a while, have read a wee bit, used shell scripts in work.
I am working to make programming a bit more part of my life. 
I am not entirely consistent, my work may not have the best practices at all times. 

I am working on doing my best and you should to. 
All I am asking at the moment... if you like something here, let me know Alex@foxmeadow.tech

Be kind. You've read all the other codes of conduct on the web and this place is another one of those spaces. 

Thank you for taking time to look here. Hopefully I write something helpful one day. 

Have an excellent day!
